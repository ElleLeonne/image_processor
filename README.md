# image_processor
An image processor for a modular vision pipeline

Pass in a list of lists, with any number of images per child list, and the processor will take care of batching and processing them, and then reconstruct the original list afterwards.

This was originally designed as part of a larger project, and it's a portion I'm okay uploading publicly due to it having very little proprietary information.
